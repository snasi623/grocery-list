Fridge Friend
# Functionality
Create a Meal that you plan to eat for the week and add the ingredients you will need to prepare the meal. Then at the bottom of the app, select the meals that you would like to eat during the week and the app will create your grocery list for you. 
# Components
Each folder contains all the files associated with each component. GroceryList houses the Groceries and Meal components.  
# Languages
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React, lodash, axios/API
# Improvements
Needs improved styling. Amount and measurements would be helpful for consumers. Lacks the ability to edit items and needs the ability to delete ingredients. In the distant future, would like the ability to track leftover groceries to use that to meal plan in the future.
