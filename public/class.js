// //1. Suppose you have $10000 and the interest rate is 0.25%. Using JavaScript calculate how much money you will have in 10 years and write it to the console.
// let amount = 10000;
// let interest = .25;
// let years = 10;
// for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i+=) {
//     amount = amount * (1 + interest/100)
//     console.log(`After ${i} years we have $${amount}.`)
// }


//2. Create an HTML page that displays your funds year by year as you lend out your $10000 in exchange for 0.25% interest. Display the results in an unordered list.
