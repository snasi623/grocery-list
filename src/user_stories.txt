As a consumer on a diet, I want an app that will help me plan my meals in advance so that I can create a shopping list that will help me plan accordingly.

As a habitual saver, I want an app that will help me find recipes that will utilize leftover grocery items so that I don't waste. 

As a meal planner, I want an easy way to organize my trips to the grocery store that will help ensure I do not need to make a second trip.
